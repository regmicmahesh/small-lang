# Small-Lang

The work on parser is almost done. Running on local machine is fairly trivial.

## Steps

1. Clone the repository.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/regmicmahesh/small-lang
```
3. Run the following command.

```bash
go run .
```

3. You'll get a nice little prompt and have fun printing out the tokens.
